2. **Exploitation of Public-Facing Applications (T1190)**: The public-facing components (e.g., IAG Public Website, Partner Portal) are susceptible to exploitation if vulnerabilities exist.
3. **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) (T1499)**: Despite Akamai's DDoS protection, attackers may attempt to overwhelm the system with traffic.
4. **Man-in-the-Middle (T1557)**: Attackers may intercept traffic between users and the system, especially if TLS encryption is not properly enforced.

#### Internal Attacks:
1. **Insider Threat (T1074)**: Malicious insiders (e.g., developers, authorized users) may misuse their access to compromise the system.
2. **Data Destruction (T1485)**: Insiders with access to databases (e.g., Dynamo Database, Orbit Database) may delete or corrupt data.
3. **Privilege Escalation (T1068)**: Insiders may exploit vulnerabilities to gain higher privileges within the system.

#### Supply Chain Risks:
1. **Third-Party Software (T1195)**: Dependencies on third-party services (e.g., Akamai, NewRelic) introduce risks if these services are compromised.
2. **Software Supply Chain Compromise (T1195.002)**: Attackers may compromise the software supply chain to introduce malicious code into the system.

### Specific Components and Risks:
1. **Akamai**: While providing security services, it is a critical point of failure. If compromised, it can lead to widespread impact.
